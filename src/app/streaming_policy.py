"""
Segment tracking and finalization for streaming transcription.

This module maintains a cumulative transcript that persists across sliding
ASR windows. It solves a key problem with streaming ASR: segments from
earlier in the conversation would be lost when the window slides forward.

Key concepts:
    - Cumulative Transcript: All segments ever detected are kept, even when
      no longer in the current ASR window
    - Segment Merging: New hypotheses merge with existing segments based on
      50%+ time overlap
    - Time-Based Finalization: Segments finalize when their end time is
      STABILITY_SEC in the past (not when text stabilizes)

Finalization state machine:
    1. NEW: Segment detected in ASR window, added to cumulative_segments
    2. UPDATING: Segment re-detected, text/timing may change
    3. STABLE: Segment end time is STABILITY_SEC ago
    4. FINALIZED: Moved to finalized_segments, queued for translation

Why time-based finalization?
    Text-based stability detection is unreliable - Whisper may refine text
    even for old audio. Time-based approach ensures segments finalize
    predictably when they're safely in the past.
